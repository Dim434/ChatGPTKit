# ChatGPTKit
A very simple Swifty API to use ChatGPT from OpenAI. Please let me know if you find any errors.

## Installation
1. In your Xcode project, go to File -> Add Packages
2. Enter the package URL: `https://https://github.com/heysaik/ChatGPTKit`
3. Click on **Add Package** and let Xcode install the Swift Package

## Usage
```swift
let chattyGPT = ChatGPTKit(apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY")
var history = [ChatGPTKit.Message(role: .user, content: "Hello Swift ChatGPT")]

switch try await chattyGPT.performCompletions(messages: history) {
case .success(let response):
    let firstResponse = response.choices[0]
    history.append(firstResponse.message)
    print(firstResponse.message.content)
case .failure(let error):
    print(error)
}
```

## Types
This can help you understand how to use the package better. This is an exact Swift copy of the response object from the OpenAI API.
### Model
```swift
enum Model {
    case turbo
    case turbo31
}
```

### Role
Typically, a conversation is formatted with a system message first, followed by alternating user and assistant messages.
- The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant.
- The user messages help instruct the assistant. They can be generated by the end users of an application, or set by a developer as an instruction.
- The assistant messages help store prior responses. They can also be written by a developer to help give examples of desired behavior.

```swift
enum Role {
    case system
    case user
    case assistant
}
```

### Message
Messages must be an array of message objects, where each object has a role (either “system”, “user”, or “assistant”) and content (the content of the message). Conversations can be as short as 1 message or fill many pages.
```swift
struct Message {
    var role: Role
    var content: String
}
```

### APIUsage
```swift
struct APIUsage {
    var prompt_tokens: Int
    var completion_tokens: Int
    var total_tokens: Int
}
```

### ResponseChoice
```swift
struct ResponseChoice {
    var index: Int
    var message: Message
    var finish_reason: String
}
```

### Response
```swift
struct Response {
    var id: String
    var object: String
    var created: Int
    var choices: [ResponseChoice]
    var usage: APIUsage
}
```
